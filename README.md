# Amazon Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to uncover meaningful insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.  
It is built and explored using *Python* in *Google Colab* with visualization and data analysis libraries.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to perform *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on Amazon sales data to:

- Identify top-selling products and categories  
- Understand regional or seasonal sales patterns  
- Analyze profit margins and discounts  
- Visualize key trends using graphs and charts  

---

## Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Pandas* – Data manipulation  
- *NumPy* – Numerical computation  
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – Data visualization  
- *Google Colab* – Notebook environment

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains details such as:
- Order ID  
- Product Category  
- Quantity Ordered  
- Unit Price  
- Discount  
- Profit  
- Date of Purchase  
- Region / Country  

> You can upload your own dataset or use the provided Amazon_Sales_Data.csv.
